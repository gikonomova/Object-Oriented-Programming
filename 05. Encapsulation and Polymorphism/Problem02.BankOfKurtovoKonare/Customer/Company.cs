//A bank holds different types of accounts for its customers: deposit accounts, loan accounts and mortgage accounts. 
//Customers could be individuals or companies.
//All accounts have customer, balance and interest rate (monthly based). 
//Deposit accounts are allowed to deposit and withdraw money. Loan and mortgage accounts can only deposit money.
//All accounts can calculate their interest for a given period (in months) using the formula
//A = money * (1 + interest rate * months) 
//Loan accounts have no interest for the first 3 months if held by individuals and for the first 2
//months if held by a company.
//Deposit accounts have no interest if their balance is positive and less than 1000.
//Mortgage accounts have ½ interest for the first 12 months for companies and no interest for the first 
//6 months for individuals.
//Write a program to model the bank system with classes and interfaces. You should identify the classes,
//interfaces, base classes and abstract actions and implement the calculation of the interest functionality
//through overridden methods. Write a program to demonstrate that your classes work correctly.
